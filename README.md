This is can be cloned as an Android project with full source code for Firebase add records for name and email for people interested in developing

Going forward we shall use various IOT platforms, as discussed, to work around contexts created from devices as uniform json data structure in the Firebase.
If you want to Fork and develop in your own way ,put a pull request to merge with master or we can keep parallel masters with enough description of differences.
